Shared Dependencies:

1. **OAuth2 Tokens**: Both frontend and backend files will need to use the OAuth2 tokens for YouTube API access. These tokens are generated in "frontend/oauth2_integration.py" and used in "backend/youtube_upload.py".

2. **Audio File and Spectrogram Data**: The audio file data and generated spectrogram are shared between "backend/spectrogram_generation.py", "backend/video_creation.py", and "backend/youtube_upload.py". 

3. **DOM Elements**: The frontend files will share DOM elements for user interaction. For example, the OAuth2 authorization button, progress bars, success notifications, and error messages.

4. **Error Messages**: Both frontend and backend files will share error messages for consistent error handling and feedback. These are defined in "frontend/error_handling_feedback.py" and "backend/error_handling_feedback.py".

5. **Function Names**: Functions for generating spectrograms, creating videos, and uploading to YouTube will be shared across the backend files. These functions are defined in "backend/spectrogram_generation.py", "backend/video_creation.py", and "backend/youtube_upload.py".

6. **YouTube Video and Playlist IDs**: The IDs for the uploaded YouTube videos and playlists are shared between "backend/youtube_upload.py" and "frontend/oauth2_integration.py" for managing the uploads.

7. **File Metadata**: The original audio file's metadata, such as creation date and file name, are shared between "backend/video_creation.py" and "backend/youtube_upload.py" for naming and categorizing the uploads.

8. **Message Names**: The names of success notifications and error messages are shared between the frontend and backend for consistent user feedback. These are defined in "frontend/error_handling_feedback.py" and "backend/error_handling_feedback.py".
